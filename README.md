# zip-stream v0.1.0-alpha [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ctalkington/node-zip-stream.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ctalkington/node-zip-stream)

zip-stream is a streaming zip generator. It was built to be a successor to [node-zipstream](https://github.com/wellawaretech/node-zipstream). Dependencies are kept to a minimum through the use of many of node's built-in modules including the use of zlib module for compression.

## Install

```bash
npm install zip-stream --save
```

You can also use `npm install https://github.com/ctalkington/node-zip-stream/archive/master.tar.gz` to test upcoming versions.
